This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle bug in shell scripting involving race conditions. The `bug.sh` script attempts to process files concurrently using subshells and background processes. However, this approach creates a race condition where the variable `file` is modified while the subshells are still referencing it.  The solution illustrates a proper way to handle concurrency to prevent this issue.
